/**
 * This class accounts for method declarations in the intermediate language.

 * 
 * @param T
 *            is the return type, if known at compile time, otherwise put
 *            OOTType. That way java generics grant us some level of type
 *            checking of the generated code at compiler design time. Sometimes
 *            we will not be able to use this though, because we will not know T
 *            at compiler design time.
