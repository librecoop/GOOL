/**
 * This class captures all the expressions of the intermediate language which we
 * have not bothered to represent in the Abstract Syntax Tree. Its code will
 * compile in the target language just as it is. It is an OOTExpr.
 * 
 * @param T
 *            is the type of this expression, if known at compile time,
 *            otherwise put OOTType. That way java generics grant us some level
 *            of type checking of the generated code at compiler design time.
 *            Sometimes we will not be able to use this though, because we will
 *            not know T at compiler design time.
