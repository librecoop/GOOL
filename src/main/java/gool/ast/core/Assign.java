/**
 * This class accounts for assignments in the intermediate language. Hence it is
 * a Statement.
 * 
 * @param T
 *            is the type of the variable, if known at compile time, otherwise
 *            IType is used. The value must have an IType which extends this
 *            type. That way java generics grant us some level of type checking
 *            of the generated code at compiler design time. Sometimes we will
 *            not be able to use this though, because we will not know T at
 *            compiler design time.
