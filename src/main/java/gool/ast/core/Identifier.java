/**
 * This class captures a variable declaration in the intermediate language.
 * Hence it is a Dec. But because declarations are usually OK statements in OO
 * Languages it is also a Statement
 * 
 * @param T
 *            is the type of the declared variable, if known at compile time,
 *            otherwise put IType. That way java generics grant us some level of
 *            type checking of the generated code at compiler design time.
 *            Sometimes we will not be able to use this though, because we will
 *            not know T at compiler design time.
